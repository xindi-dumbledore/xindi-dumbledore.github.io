I went to the [Computational Social Science Summer School](http://summerschool.computationalsocialscience.eu/2018/#schedule) in Los Angeles in the summer of 2018. It was a full week summer school with awesome lectures and one project. The project I participated in was Cyberbullying on Instagram, collaborated with Qinyu E, Reham Al Tamine, Sijia Yang, with advisor Prof Homa Hosseinmardi. Our project luckily won the Best Project Award Prize for the Summer School! Here are the [slides]({{ "/assets/cyberbullying.pdf"}}) for our project!
