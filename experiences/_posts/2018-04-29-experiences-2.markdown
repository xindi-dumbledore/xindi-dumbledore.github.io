I participated the Complex System Summer School at Santa Fe Institute this summer. It is a one-month long program with extensive lectures, projects, and a lot of fun! I participated in two projects:

- Understanding music using higher order networks (see more details in [Projects](https://xindi-dumbledore.github.io/projects/index.html))
- Analyzing Singapore public transportation data and economic sector clustering

Addtionally, several of us went to a ranch in Colorado to see yaks and get yak milk to make yak butter tea from scratch!
