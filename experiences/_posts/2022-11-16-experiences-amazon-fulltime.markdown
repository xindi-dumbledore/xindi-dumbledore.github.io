I worked as an Applied Scientist II since October 2021. I worked in Alexa AI and was responsible for entity resolution models. For a voice assistant as Alexa, Entity Resolution is the step to search from the huge catalog (hundreds, thousands and millions music, podcast, videos, etc.) and retrieve the desired result based on user's query. During my time, I worked on two projects:

**Ranker-based Entity Exploration Model for Entity Resolution**
- Lead, design and develop a ranker-based entity exploration model for entity resolution
- Applied the model on a use case with more than 500K weekly traffic. Through online A/B test and offline analysis, demonstrate an improvement of 5.04% comparing to the current production system

**Graph-based Data Augmentation for Entity Resolution**
- Design and develop graph-based data augmentation method for entity resolution for a use-cases with more than 500K traffic weekly to improve robustness to upstream ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) error. 
- Experiment achieves 5.19% improvement on accuracy overall, and 27.86% improvement on harder cases.
