I worked as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon for Summer 2019 and Fall 2020. For the two internships, I worked on projects related to natural language processing and learning to rank.


**Cross-query Ranker on ASR N-best for Entity Resolution (Fall 2020, Alexa AI)**
- Develop a machine learning ranker to leverage results from upstream ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) to make the Entity Resolution result robust to ASR errors
- Experiment the ranker on two use-cases with 100k examples and 1 million examples separately, and achieved about 10% gain in accuracy.

**Entity linking on Customer Reviews and Queries (Summer 2019, Amazon Search)**
- Using natural language processing and learning to rank method, developed an entity linking system using wikipedia data on customer queries and reviews. 
- Designed evaluation method on both wikipedia data and collected Mechanical Turk labeled data, and achieved about 20% improvement comparing to baseline.
