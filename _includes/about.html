             Greetings! I'm Xindi Wang, a Ph.D. in Network Science. I'm currently working at Fidelity Investments as a Senior Data Scientist on various machine learning applications. Previously, I worked as an Applied Scientist II in Amazon Alexa AI, making Alexa smarter to retrieve desired results for customers. Prior to Amazon, I obtained a Ph.D. degree from Northeastern in Network Science, working with Prof. Albert-László Barabási and Prof. Tina Eliassi-Rad. My research projects include network science, computational social science, machine learning and data science.
