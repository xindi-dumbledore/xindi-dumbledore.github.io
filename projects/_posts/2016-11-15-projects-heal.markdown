title: Ranker-based Entity Exploration Model for Entity Resolution
description: |
---
In this project, I lead, design and develop a ranker-based entity exploration model for entity resolution in Alexa. Our goal is to suggest alternative results comparing to the production system and collect customer feedback on such results while not hurting customer experience. These collected feedback would be useful for future model iteration.

I applied the model on a use case with more than 500K weekly traffic. Through online A/B test and offline analysis, I demonstrate an improvement of 5.04% comparing to the current production system.
