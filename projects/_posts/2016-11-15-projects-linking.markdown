description: |
---
In this project, I used natural language processing and learning to rank method and developed an entity linking system using wikipedia data on customer queries and reviews, which would be useful to enrich knowledge for search.
I designed evaluation method on both wikipedia data and collected Mechanical Turk labeled data, and achieved about 20% improvement comparing to baseline.
