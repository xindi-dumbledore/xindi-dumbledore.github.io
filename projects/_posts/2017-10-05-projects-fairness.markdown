Fairness in Machine Learning has become an arising topic recently. With increasing application of Machine Learning algorithms in daily lives, people have found out those algorithms can be "unfair" since the data is biased. We recently started a project "Just ML" with Prof. Tina Eliassi-Rad and Dr. Onur Varol, trying to quantify two potential sources of "unfairness": in-group favortism" and "out-group prejudice" using the COMPAS data. The project is still in its early stage.
