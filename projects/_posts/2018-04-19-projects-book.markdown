title: Success of Books and Authors
description: |
---
I worked on a project *Success of Books and Authors* in collaboration with Burcu Yucesoy, Onur Varol, Prof Tina Eliassi-Rad and Prof Albert-László Barabási. We are interested in why some books and authors become successful.

Our first paper in this project in *EPJ Data Science*. We analzed the *New York Times* Bestseller data and found a lot of interesting pattern in it. We also have an interactive visualization website and it's fun to play with!

Our second paper in this project is on analyzing the contribution factors that make a book successful. We build a machine learning model to predict book sales from various features. This task is challenging since book sales is heavy-tailed distributed, and traditional machine learning models are prune to underpredict books with high sales. To tackle this, we build an algorithm called Learning to Place. We also analyzed the feature importance that contribute to book's success.
