title: Cross-query Ranker on ASR N-best for Entity Resolution
description: |
---
In this project, I develop a machine learning ranker to leverage results from upstream ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) to make the Entity Resolution result robust to ASR errors. I experiment the ranker on two use-cases with 100k examples and 1 million examples separately, and achieved about 10% gain in accuracy.
