title: Graph-based Data Augmentation for Entity Resolution
description: |
---
Upstream ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) can influence downstream tasks such as Entity Resolution. In this project, I design and develop a graph-based data augmentation method to make the Entity Resolution more robust to the upstream error. I experiment the method on a use-case with more than 500K traffic weekly, and found that it can achieve 5.19% improvement on accuracy overall, and 27.86% improvement on harder cases. I also extend this method using graph neural network.
