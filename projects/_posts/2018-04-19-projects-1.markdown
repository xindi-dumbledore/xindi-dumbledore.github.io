I'm currently working on a project *Success of Books and Authors* in collaboration with Burcu Yucesoy, Onur Varol, Prof Tina Eliassi-Rad and Prof Albert-László Barabási. We are interested in why some books and authors become successful.

We recently published our first paper in this project in *EPJ Data Science*. We analzed the *New York Times* Bestseller data and found a lot of interesting pattern in it. We also have an interactive visualization website and it's fun to play with!

- Check the [visualizations](http://bestsellers.barabasilab.com)!

We are currently working on the prediction of book sales prior to the publication of a book. I have shown part of our results at various conferences:
