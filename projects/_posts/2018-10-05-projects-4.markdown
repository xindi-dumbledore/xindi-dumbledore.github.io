title: Understanding Music using Networks
description: |
---
Started as a course project, I initially collaborated with Syed Haque trying to understand music from the sheet music purely. We built the one-step note transition matrix for music pieces and use these matrices to cluster music; we found the matrices themselves are very distinct for Bach's Fugue and the clusters we found aligns with music era. Check our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08928)!

During the Santa Fe Summer School, I pitched this music related project and collaborated with Josefine Brask, Ricky Laishram and Carlos Marcelo, trying to understand music by building higher-order networks. We came up with several metrics to quantify different charateristics of music from those higher-order networks such as "branchingness", "repetitiveness", etc., and try to connect them with different music genres. Here are the related [slides]({{ "/assets/understanding_music.pdf"}})!
