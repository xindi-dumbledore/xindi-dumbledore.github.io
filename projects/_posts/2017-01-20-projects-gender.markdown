title: Quantifying Systemic Gender Inequality in Visual Art
description: |
---
From disparities in the number of exhibiting artists to auction opportunities, there is overwhelming evidence of women’s under-representation in visual art, rooted in a complex and largely unknown interplay between gender, artistic performance and institutional practices. 
In this project we explore the exhibitions and auction sales of 65,768 gender-identified contemporary artists in 20,389 institutions, confirming systemic gender differences in the artist population, exhibitions and auctions. 
We distinguish between gender-neutrality, when artists have gender-independent access to exhibition opportunities and gender-balance, that strives for gender parity in representation, finding that 55% of institutions are gender-neutral but only 30% are gender-balanced, and that the fraction of man-preferred institutions increases with institutional prestige.
Finally, we use machine learning to predict an artist's access to the auction market, finding that co-exhibition gender, capturing the gender inequality of the institutions that an artist embraces has a higher impact on success than the artist's gender. 
These results help unveil and quantify the institutional forces that contribute to the persistent gender imbalance in the art world.
