My part time is mostly filled with music. I'm an amateur piano player since I only learned electronic keyboard in my childhood and never learned the piano formally. I have a digital piano at home and I record piano pieces from time to time. It reduces the stress from my PhD life.

- Recently I fall in love with Mendelssohn's *Lieder ohne Worte*. And here is my recording of *Lieder ohne Worte, Op.30: No. 6. Allegretto in F sharp minor "Venetian Gondola Song"* <audio controls="controls">

- One of my long time favorite composers is Yann Tiersen. I first heard about him from the Movie Am√©lie. Here is my recording from his recent release piano works EUSA.
- I love Bach.
